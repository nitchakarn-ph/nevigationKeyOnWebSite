        <p>My other cat, colored black and white, is a sweetie. He followed us to the pool today, walking down the
            pavement with us. Yesterday he apparently visited our neighbours. I wonder if he recognizes that their flat
            is a mirror image of ours.</p>
        <p>Hm, I just noticed that in the last paragraph I used British English. But I’m supposed to write in American
            English. So I shouldn’t say "pavement" or "flat" or "color"...</p>
