        <h2>Navigation</h2>
        <p>You are on my home page. To the north lies <a href="/blog">my blog</a>, from whence the sounds of battle can
            be heard. To the east you can see a large mountain, upon which many <a href="/school">school papers</a> are
            littered. Far up this mountain you can spy a little figure who appears to be me, desperately scribbling out
            a <a href="/school/thesis">thesis</a>.</p>
        <p>To the west are several exits. One fun-looking exit is labeled <a
                href="https://games.example.com/">"games"</a>. Another more boring-looking exit is labeled <a
                href="https://isp.example.net/">ISPâ„¢</a>.</p>
        <p>To the south lies a dark and dank <a href="/about">contacts page</a>. Cobwebs cover its disused entrance, and
            at one point you see a rat run quickly out of the page.</p>
